## Intro

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day using Day.js This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.





##  Description

I am using a daily planner to create a schedule. When open the planner
and the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. Where each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a timeblock to create an event and click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage.


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
